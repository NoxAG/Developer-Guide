# Developers Guide

## GitHub
We use GitHub for collaborating on our new.nox project. This includes sharing of our code and documentation, giving feedback to new code and organizing the whole project. 
To be able to work on this project, you have to sign up to GitHub and join the NoxAG organisation.

### What the fuck is GitHub?
For everyone that hasn't heard of GitHub or doesn't know what exactly is GitHub for, here are a view videos and websites that explain the main concept:

- Introduction Video: [Idea of GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)
- Video Playlist with videos for all the important git commands: [Github and Git Foundations](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0lo9MOBetEHhfG9vJzVCTiDYcbhAiEqL)
-An interactive tutorial to learn every important aspect of Git: [The Interativ Guid to GitHub](http://learngitbranching.js.org/)

*The interactive tutorial is **for everyone** and sould at least be completed partially.*

Here a short list of chapters that are essential for understanding and using git:

- Main
  - Einführung
    - Einführung in Git Commits
    - Branches in Git
    - Mergen in git
    - Einführung in Rebase
    
- Remote
  - Push & Pull -- entfernte Repositorys
    - Clone Einführung
    - Clone Einführung
    - Git Fetch
    - Git Pull
    - Teamarbeit simulieren
    - Git Push
    - Abweichende History
    
The other chapters of this tutorial are also quite good, but not necessary for the average use of Git 

### Sign up to GitHub
To sign up to GitHub just follow this [link](https://github.com/) and create an account.
If you want to get the free *Student Developer Pack* which gives acces to a number of otherwise costly developer tools just follow this [link](https://education.github.com/pack) and apply for your *GitHub Student Package*. (You'll need to add your ...@student.dhbw-mannheim.de mailing address to verify that you are actually a student)

### Join the NoxAG Organisation
Organisations in GitHub are used to manage group-owned repositorys and projects. All members of one organisation are part of the team and can be assigned different access rights. 
After you sign up to GitHub you can be invited to the NoxAG Organisation. After you have been invited you can either follow the link that should be in the invitation mail or you can just go to the [NoxAG Github Page](https://github.com/NoxAG) and accept your invite.

### How we use GitHub

#### Structure of our projects
To make sure that we can all work independently on small parts of our project without interfering in each others work, we are going to devide our project in multiple repositorys. To make this work, we will have one "NewNox-Application" repository wich is going to represent the main repository of our project. This repository depends on all the other repositors like "NewNox-Textanalyzer" or "NewNox-GUI" and all the others that we may have. Furthermore we are going to have one "NewNox-Common" repository as dependency to all other repositories that is going to contain all the classes and methods that need to be accessed by every or nearly every repository. In an optimal way this repository is going to be empty and can later be discarded.
